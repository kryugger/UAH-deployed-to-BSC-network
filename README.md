## 🇺🇦 UAH Token — Digital Hryvnia, the settlement digital currency of Independent Ukraine

**UAH Token** is not just a cryptocurrency. It is a digital symbol of freedom, dignity and invincibility of the Ukrainian people. Created on the Polygon blockchain, the token reflects the national currency — the hryvnia — in a decentralized, transparent and global form.

But its real power is in the **number of tokens**:
**24081991 coins — a number that carries historical meaning.**

### 🔐 Why 24081991?

This is not a random emission. It is the **digital embodiment of the year 1991**, when Ukraine gained independence after centuries of enslavement.

- **August 24, 1991** — the day when the Verkhovna Rada proclaimed the independence of Ukraine.
- Each token is a piece of memory of the day when Ukraine told the world: **"We are free!"**

### 🛡️ Token of resistance and revival

The path to independence was long and painful:

- From **Cossack uprisings** to **Ukrainian People's Republic**

- From **Holodomor** to **Revolution of Dignity**

- From **first referendum** to **modern struggle for freedom**

**UAH Token** is a digital monument to this struggle. It is a way to honor the past and build the future.
